Hello everyone!
 
Since the 10+ key community is small,
I'm trying to get it together with a discord server.
It features channels for multiple rhythm games with 10k+ support, mapping, modding, resources, specific languages, stuff like that.
It also has some useful bots, admin/moderator roles and a leveling system.
Things you would expect from a decent server...
If you are interested, consider joining.
